! Decay Supression
ParticleDecays:limitTau0 = on          ! Only particles with tau0 < tau0Max are decayed.
ParticleDecays:tau0Max = 0.01          ! tau0Max of 0.01 will stop all weak decays, allowing us to directly count charm/beauty hadrons. 

! strange hadron decays off
! Note that K0 (K0bar) are allowed to decay!
! If we use decay suppression, these are redundant, except for the sigma0 which decays with tau0 ~ e(-8).
! All other strange hadrons decay with tau0 > 10.

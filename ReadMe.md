This is a repository of assorted code, scripts, macro's, etc. I use for my research. It will mostly consist of C++ scripts and headers (ROOT, PYTHIA), python (PyROOT), bash (steering scripts), and various other files like config files. 

Use at your own risk! I once managed to get a segmentation violation with 2 lines of python code, so be warned.
